# fodmap-recipe-helper
I personally needed to follow a special diet (low-FODMAP). I can get lazy with these stuff quickly, so decided to create my own application, which can help me in planning my meals accordingly.

It is an application, which can store recipes with the list of indigents, generate a weekly meal and the shopping list for these recipes in advance.

## Out of initial scope, but upcoming features

- Having a web page with WebAssembly
- add a list of items at home and suggest recipes
