# fodmap-recipe-helper
I personally needed to follow a special diet (low-FODMAP). I can get lazy with these stuff quickly, so decided to create my own application, which can help me in planning my meals accordingly.

It is an application, which can store recipes with the list of indigents, generate a weekly meal and the shopping list for these recipes in advance.

The application provides a very simple terminal UI, which can be used to interact with the application.

## Features

- Add new recipes
- Generate a weekly meal plan
- Generate a shopping list for the meal plan
- List all recipes

## Out of initial scope, but upcoming features

- Having a web page with WebAssembly
- add a list of items at home and suggest recipes
- Notes feature about the symptoms
